The [Timers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Timers) received the ability to loop
the timers you create in them to continuously reset themselves

![Loop Timers](/img/blog/1.6.12-Release/Loop-Timers.png)

The [Bank plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Bank) now has the `Keyboard Bankpin` option to let you
input your Bank pin by pressing the corresponding number keys on your keyboard.

The [GPU plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU) has been updated to include a
`Compute Shaders` option, these enable the draw distance to exceed the default of 25.
For people who might have a hard time running the plugin, disabling this could assist you.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- [Grand Exchange](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange): Improved fuzzy search highlighting
- [Idle Notifier](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Idle-Notifier): Now knows the enchanting bolts
  and fishing with pearl rod animations
- [Fishing](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Fishing): Correctly displays `FISHING` when using a pearl rod
- [Agility](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility): Laps per hour is now displayed on the overlay
- [Screen Markers](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Screen-Markers): Prevented from being
  accidentally reset and subsequently disappearing
- HotKeys: No longer consume key presses on the login screen
